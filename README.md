Singlepage Website
====================
I refactored the frontend into a series of pages and more reusable components. I also played with more advanced angular techniques like routing and views to build each page. The website is now a single page application so all javascript is within its own app. The single page frontend provides a graphical view for the json back end objects.

Significant Pages
-----------------
* Index
  * Consists of 3 major components
    * Menu 
      * Basic menubar provides a linking to all parts of the website. (About me, coding teasers, projects ...)
    * Slides
      * Image and Text describing the picture. Link to article or route with more information about the image or text.
    * Article List
      * Article Title and blurb. Link to the rest of the article if interested.

  * 2 parts list of available coding teasers
    * List of coding teasers created. 
    * Problem and Soluion page for each individual teaser created.
